Organising tests
1. It's a good practice to Organise tests.
2. We can put the tests in a directory named tests. If the directory doesn't exist in our project, We
can create it and jest will automatically find it.
3. Each file with the name *.test.js is referred to a test suite and each of such a file should be moved to tests directory
4. We can futher subdivide the tests directory into int and unit subdirectories to represent integration and unit tests respectively.
5. To run all the test suites we run npm test 
6. To run/execute a specific test suite we use the npm test -- tests/subdirectory/testsuite file e.g:
npm test -- test/int/api to perform api integration tests using the tests/int/api.test.js test suite 

* What is a unit test?
is a verification of thee functionality of the particular unit in code or program. This commonly refers to testing particular function.

*What is an integration tes?
is a verification of the functionality of different units or functions that depend on each other. This commonly refers to testing two or more functions that rely/depend on each other.

* There are many other tests especially e2e or end to end or UI tests, acceptance tests etc.
